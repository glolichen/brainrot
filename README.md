| Brainrot Phrase | Brainfuck Symbol | Explanation                                                          |
|-----------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SKIBIDI         | >                | increases memory pointer, or moves the pointer to the right 1 block  |
| TOILET          | <                | decreases memory pointer, or moves the pointer to the left 1 block   |
| SIGMA           | +                | increases value stored at the block pointed to by the memory pointer |
| BETA            | -                | decreases value stored at the block pointed to by the memory pointer |
| SUS             | [                | like c while(cur_block_value != 0) loop                              |
| AMOGUS          | ]                | if block currently pointed to's value is not zero, jump back to [    |
| GOON            | ,                | like c getchar(). input 1 character                                  |
| RIZZ            | .                | like c putchar(). print 1 character to the console                   |
| GYATT           | N/A              | rest of the line is a comment                                        |

All phrases must be typed in CAPITAL LETTERS. They are the most sigma and lower case is beta. Your code will not compile if beta letters are found.

Phrases are separated by whitespaces or new line characters. Unlike Brainfuck, Brainrot introduces a new comment symbol, GYATT. GYATT and any characters following it on that line are comments and not compiled.

## The Other Brainrot

Apparently, there's [another](https://github.com/glapa-grossklag/brainrot) Brainrot programming language by [Miles Glapa-Grossklag](https://github.com/glapa-grossklag). This Brainrot language has nothing to do with that project. Nonetheless, I trust that my sus imposter language will be more sigma and have more rizz than the original.
